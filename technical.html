        <div class="leftbox">I have done lot of research for this game as I want it to be best experience for the all players. We have looks at games like Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. We had looked at the skeletons in Black Flag on how they worked.

            They are very similar to ours as with movement as if they you see in the game, they will start to chase you and attack you with custom aminations. Also, the system for the health is similar as health of skeletons will be low but do a lot of damage to the player’s health.
            
            The gun model we are using in the game is a rusty U.S. model 1842 percussion pistol with custom firing animations if possible as we are trying to find one that works but we have found nothing just yet. Some games like Assassin’s Creed III and Call of Juarez: Gunslinger has it but also games like Read Dead Redemption and Mount & Blade Warband can be add with mods.

        <div class="rightbox">The Visual style of the game would be realistic with amazing graphic buts it will be well optimize. The colours are blue and green to match tropical island. The sky in the game is alway day time in the afternoon so players can see all the skeletons.       </div>
